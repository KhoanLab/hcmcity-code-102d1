### Tips for Success

Get ready to tackle some seriously ambitious material! You'll have the most success if you:

- Take notes during class.
- Keep up with the daily assignments (code and reading).
- Research topics that are new or confusing.
- Speak up when you're stuck for more than 15 minutes.
- Be thorough and deliberate when reading error messages and console/terminal responses. Take your time and do not go too fast. Always know what you are doing.
- And, above all else, pay attention to details.
